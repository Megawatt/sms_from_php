= Send SMS from PHP
===============================================================

This project demonstrates how to send SMS messages from PHP. The main code file is index.php.

The general idea is that all major US carriers allow sending 
SMS messages to a phone number using an email address format.
For example, in the AT&T case the address would be 

555-111-2222@txt.att.net

where 555-111-2222 is the destination phone number (change that to a real number you
want to send the message to).

PHPmailer is used for outgoing messages. For completeness, the PHPmailer scripts for SMTP
are included here. PHPmailer can be found at the following address, including license
information:

http://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/phpmailer/

To make this demo work for you, you will need to edit config.php to include
your smtp server address etc. Note that in this example authentication is not used - you may need to add
it depending on your smtp server configuration. See the README file in the PHPmailer documentation.

The makefile on the top level directory makes it easy to install the files to a local server 
directory:
 
 1) change the target directory in the makefile according to your directory structure, 
    e.g. /var/www/sms
 2) type "make install" or "sudo make install" 

To remove the installed files from the target directory, type

   make clean  (or sudo make clean)
